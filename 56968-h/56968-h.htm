<p class='c003'>With the October issue, Captain
Billy’s Whiz Bang will
start on its second year. In celebration
of the event, the editor
will dish out to the readers his
choicest morsels from the first
twelve issues. Since the inception
of this little journal of uplift,
the circulation has increased
so rapidly that it has been difficult
at times to keep up with
the procession. With a view to
giving the thousands of new
readers the best poems, jokes
and stories from the previous
12 issues, the first annual “<i>Whiz
Bang Year Book</i>” will make its
appearance in the form of the
October number. There will be
plenty of new material, also,
mixed in with the cream of the
first 12 copies.—<i>The Editor.</i></p>

    <div>BY MARION</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c017'>HOLLYWOOD, beautiful little suburb of Los Angeles
and famous as America’s leading movie
hot-house, is running pretty nowadays with its
many wondrous autos and, Oh! those numerous and
naughty little, palpitating bungalow intrigues.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Mary Pickford-Doug Fairbanks romance, is
almost old stuff with Mary and Doug on a bit of a
honeymoon in New York and London, while forty
eleven representatives of the daily papers accompanied
them as far as Arizona to watch the Moki Indians get
their first glimpse of the screen.</p>

<p class='c018'>One of the merriest rumors just now extant regards
another member of the Pickford family, to-wit,
Lottie. Lottie is a live wire in the parlance of the country
clubs and cafes. In southern California, until the
“prohis” bore down, the word “country club” meant
one of the nightly places of revelry, stretched all the
way from Vernon to the beach. These places are somewhat
on the blink now, but it has been known that a
stray “shot in the arm” has been seen to take effect.
In fact a wagon load recently was taken to the police
station from Vernon.</p>

<p class='c018'>But getting back to Lottie. For a considerable
number of moons the night black eyes of Mary’s sister
beamed favorably upon a certain handsome Apollo of
the screens. It wasn’t a case of, wherever Mary went
the boy was sure to go. It was a case of, wherever
Lottie went she took the boy along. At ball games,
country clubs, bungalow dances, midnight revelries,
Lottie and her lad were together. Then came dame
rumor, and she is a busy dame in these parts. Lottie’s
man was playing with another. So far as the public
was concerned that was about all there was to it.</p>

<p class='c018'>But know ye, that Fatty Arbuckle, Roscoe he
wishes to be called of late, rented the handsome home
on West Adams street, formerly occupied by Theda
Bara. In fact it is said that Fatty sleeps in the vampire’s
bed, which may or may not, weave his dreams
with vampires and their dangerous moods.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fatty recently gave a party. He gives a lot of
them. There were picture girls galore and the wine
flowed red and every other way, for Roscoe is no derelict
of a host.</p>

<p class='c018'>It didn’t take twenty-four hours for Dame Rumor
and her children to scatter the news that “there was
some ruction among the ‘Janes’ out to Arbuckle’s joint
last night.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Just how it started was lost in the hurry of getting
down to the absolute certainty that Lottie Pickford
and another girl staged one of the prettiest scraps seen
since Charlie Chaplin tried to lick his wife’s manager
at the Alexandria hotel recently. In fact the efforts of
Charlie as a pugilist are said to have been nil compared
with the flavor that Lottie and her rival put up.
It wasn’t exactly Lottie’s rival either, so the story
goes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Seems that Lottie and another girl were talking
in one of the bedrooms regarding the “cat” who had
vamped the temporary affections of Lottie’s former
beau. A third girl was lying, supposedly asleep. She
arose suddenly and challenged, in behalf of her vamping
friend what Lottie had said. Then the riot started.
One of our well-known artists stated next day that it
was the best he had seen since Young George and Steve
Dalton first met at Jack Doyle’s. Anyone taking a good
look at Lottie would opine that the girl, when angry,
might be worth a bet in the real money book.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not much has been heard of Jack Pickford since
he became mixed up in the war time mess. It was no
Hollywood secret that Jack was not an over welcome
visitor at the home of Mary and her mother for some
time. Things may have been calmed over since Mary
settled down with Doug, or rather tried to settle down
with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Olive Thomas, Jack’s wife, recently returned from
New York and Jack met her with a Whiz Bang of a
new car. Jack claims it cost him bucks to the number
of ten thou. Speaking of automobiles, Roscoe Arbuckle
recently received a specially designed motor car that
is a humdinger. The price is reported at $25,000. If it
didn’t cost that much it sure looks it. Thousands of
people viewed the monstrosity for a week in the windows
of the motor works where it was turned out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of course the machine is simply to be used as an
ad for the prolific Fat. Some of the last words in autos
have been seen around here, but they all faded to a
sickly, measly brown when Arbuckle’s came into prominence.
Arbuckle says he intends dazzling Broadway
with it. What may help some, if he uses it in New
York, is the license number, which was displayed while
the car stood on exhibition here. The number was
“606.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“United Artists,” the “Big Four” and “Associated
Directors” are familiar terms here. Speaking
of United Artists, we must pause at mention of Charlie
Chaplin and Mildred Harris. They are not united, not
so anyone can notice.</p>

<p class='c018'>Shortly after their marriage last year, the doll-like
little Mildred and her mother were the observed
of all observers at the fashionable St. Catherine hotel,
the Wrigley’s island palace at Catalina. Wistful indeed,
appeared the little girl as she sat day after day
gazing across the Pacific blue whence fly the famous
Chaplin hydroplanes from the mainland. The hydroplanes
are a venture of Sid Chaplin. Charlie is not
in on the deal, though he makes the air trip occasionally.</p>

<p class='c018'>But never did Charlie appear to the knowledge of
the vastly interested hotel habitues. Ever with her
slender, keen looking mother, the bride waited in vain
for her Lochinvar. Occasionally she danced with a
visiting picture personage. But Charlie—he came not.</p>

<p class='c018'>Friends—friends always spread bad news—whispered
that something was wrong. The St. Catherine
seemed a haven, welcome or not, of disconsolate women.
On the broad veranda sat the woman discarded
by Earl Williams. Inquisitive society dames raised
their very proper eyebrows as they passed and the
mournful looking girl appeared as lonesome as any
girl could feel, even though Earl had, through his
lawyers, handed over a settlement admitted to be at
least $40,000.</p>

<p class='c018'>Charlie Chaplin has all the earmarks of a rather
distraught young man. He lives at the Los Angeles
Athletic club. From his studio comes the word that
though he finally is working at another picture, his people
never know whether it will be a week or a month
before he shows up to don the old derby and the familiar
shoes.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fight between Chaplin and Manager Young of
Mildred Chaplin was funny. Young is fat and the idea
of Chaplin trying to use his fists is funnier than anything
he ever did in pictures. Just what the real cause
of combat was hasn’t been thoroughly dissected by the
scandal mongers. Young says he was trying to protect
Mrs. Chaplin from annoyance by her husband.
Chaplin says Young is a big stiff and that he (Chaplin)
certainly never annoyed his wife. He hasn’t—in public—because
they never appear together.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just how the divorce proceedings will work out
nobody knows. It is true that Chaplin wishes he was
out of it. It is believed that Mrs. Chaplin’s mother is
somewhat of a business woman and will have considerable
to say before the bones of the affair have rattled
their last.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fairbanks and Chaplin are very close friends.
One of the newspapers recently published a picture of
Mary, Doug and Charlie, purporting to be one taken immediately
after the marriage, when Chaplin went to the
train with them as they left for an alleged brief scurry
to some quiet haunt. As a matter of fact the picture
was one taken at the time the trio were leaving on their
famous Liberty Loan jaunt, upon which momentous
trip Doug and Mary are supposed to have “fallen”
for each other good and hard.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Owen Moore has become a public goat. The
former husband of Mary is a likable enough fellow,
quiet and with a winning way that can’t restrain the
undoubtable sadness which lurks in a pair of wistful
eyes. By the way, ninety-nine women out of a hundred
probably would “kotow” to Moore so far as looks are
concerned, rather than to Fairbanks. Moore is well set
up and handsome in a masculine way. Doug never
could be called a thing of beauty and most of his cowboys
display better physical form than the agile laugh-maker.</p>

<p class='c018'>All the testimony given by Mary at Minden would
tend to indicate that the hour in which Owen did not
inject a lot of booze into himself, was a rare hour indeed.
If Mary asked Owen to come back to her as
often as she says she did, figuring he was the lusher
as she sets forth, then indeed Owen, if he loves the girl,
hasn’t much of a kick coming.</p>

<p class='c018'>The general opinion appears to be that Moore had
the love of Mary very much at heart but through his
tendency for liquor, finally lost out. Those who really
know Mary Pickford swear by the character of the girl.
Those who really know Moore can’t dislike him. They
simply figure he was his own worst enemy and that in
the desperate moments of her mental torture the girl
grew to care for the light-hearted Fairbanks and his
blithesome way.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Owen is just now figuring in a suit for damages
brought by someone from whom he rented a house.
The owners claim that everything was in a mess when
they came back and that an overflow of booze has considerably
depreciated the furniture.</p>

<p class='c018'>Another Hollywood “Secret” has been shattered.
It seems that a perfectly good married man went on a
visit to his “Secret” and before the evening was done
he was driving a joyful bunch of other men, with their
“Secrets,” in his latest buzz wagon.</p>

<p class='c018'>Everything would have been O. K. but for the fact
that the happy hubby permitted his own “Secret” to
sit in the back seat while helping the other revelling
benedicts to deliver their “Secrets” home. It appears
that the “Secret” of the car-owner went to
sleep in her recess in the rear of the car.</p>

<p class='c018'>The night was foggy. So was the brain of this
“perfectly good” married man. He parked the car
in his garage, forgetting all about the “Secret” lying
asleep in the back seat. Next morning a “perfectly
trusting” wife was surprised, when she stepped onto
the bungalow rear, to see a “perfectly wild Secret”
dashing madly out of the garage, clad in anything but
up-to-date morning garb.</p>

<p class='c018'>The betting in Hollywood is 100 to 1 that Nevada
prosecutors or politicians do not break the Fairbanks-Pickford
marital relations. Los Angeles herself—that
is the heart of it—says, “Let them alone. They’re
married, aren’t they, however they managed to do it?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Maybe Los Angeles prognosticators are wrong.
Maybe Nevada means business. But the prevalent sentiment
is that, unless their love-ship hits the rocks
some other way, Mary and Doug may woo and coo
until dooms-day—except at such times as they see fit
to invite the newspapers en masse to dinner or load
down autos and Pullman cars with scribes who would
fain not invade their privacy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hanging and wiving go by destiny. For every
Jonathan Wild there is somewhere an adequate John
Ketch; from the ends of the earth, noose and neck rush
to meet each other. For every Jack there is some compliant
Jill; from all the plains and valleys the couples
scramble up to the difficult ark of matrimony. Sheba
travels to Solomon and the event is set down in the
book of Kings. Caesar rules over Rome and Cleopatra
over Egypt, but the wet sundering leagues cannot separate
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nat Goodwin, it is true, never married Lillian Russell,
but the universe felt that something had gone
amiss. So says an American journalist—one of the
kind who knows everything. He continues: Destiny
had fallen down. How then should Mary Pickford and
Douglas fail to swing into the orbit calculated from
the beginning? If she is not queen of her particular
Sheba, Sheba never had a queen. If he is not the
gayest of Solomons, at least he has written a book,
and unquestionably he rules his jovial dominion in his
own right. In this wedding the royal line crosses. It
is as expected and as gratifying as the conclusion of a
feature film.</p>

<p class='c018'>Obstacles have kept the prince and princess apart,
but obstacles do not last forever. After the conflict
there must be peace, and before the final curtain there
must be a happy ending. How evil are those dispositions
which interpret this amalgamation of splendours
in economic terms; which hint that the joint revenue
of the pair—to judge by figures made elaborately public—will
be three times what he earned before; which
calculate that his income will actually pay her income
tax.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c017'>POOR devil! He was an escaped convict from
French Guiana—haggard, half-starved, barefooted;
his shirt torn as if to show his torn heart,
his trousers ragged; bareheaded, blue eyes, a mat of
brown hair, and a neat mustache and beard, reminiscent
of the Parisian boulevards. He didn’t look half so
ferocious as his black, British gorilla of a guard, who
dragged him on our boat, and later transferred him to
the train bound for Georgetown, Demerara, to languish
in jail till the French mail steamer arrived to take him
back captive to Cayenne. I took pity on him, gave him
some fruit, chocolate and money, wished him a bon
voyage, and was sorry I couldn’t give him his liberty as
well.</p>

<p class='c018'>French Guiana is a penal colony, a prison of 35,000
square miles, bounded by Dutch Guiana, Brazil and
the Atlantic ocean. Out of a population of some 40,000,
10,000 are convicts. While there are exports of balata
and phosphates, the principal ones are gold, cocoa,
hides, rosewood and rosewood oil, the last shipped to
France as a substitute for attar of roses. But the glitter
of the gold is dimmed by the shadow of the prison,
and above the fragrance of the rosewood rises the
stench of political putridity, convict crime and corruption.</p>

<p class='c018'>From her earliest history, Cayenne has furnished
an inspired chapter for the Devil’s Bible, written with
finger of fire in ink of blood. In the first of the seventeenth
century the settlers not only had before them
the interesting fate of being massacred and devoured
by the cannibal Indians, but a providential blessing in
the form of their mad commander, Sieur de Bretigny,
who, not satisfied with torturing the 400 colonists with
gibbet, gallows and wheel, amused himself by instituting
pleasures called “Purgatory” and “Hell,” in
which he forced them to relate even their dreams as
to a father confessor; if he were displeased, he maltreated
and killed them. The next batch of settlers
mutinied en route from France, and on arriving here so
angered the Indians by enslaving and plundering them
that the natives forced them to take refuge in a fort
where Famine and Disease were the red man’s best
allies.</p>

<p class='c018'>Succeeding colonization companies were failures.
Mismanagement and Misfortune were president and
vice-president of the ventures. For example, in 1763,
12,000 volunteer colonists came to French Guiana, with
the promise of free lands, which proved to be free
graves. By 1765, 11,000 died. They landed and lived
in mud and water; there were no tools for tilling the
soil, yet they had a shop to make skates in this equatorial
clime; drinking water there was none, probably
because they thought it would rain or they might be
able to get wine; rivers rose, and not knowing how to
dike them, those who lived through the fevers died from
the floods. Such colonial schemes are finely satirized
by Daudet in his “Port Tarascon.” At best, the French
are the worst colonizers, whether here or in Tahiti,
Marquesas, Caledonia, Panama, Algeria, Canada and
Martinique. Cayenne next became the criminal cesspool
of France, costing the lives of hundreds and 800,000
livres.</p>

<p class='c018'>During the French Revolution men were arrested
in Paris, paraded before the populace like wild beasts
in cages, then shipped to Cayenne, the white man’s
grave. Of 600 Royalists transported here and landed
on the Sinnamaire River without shelter or food, two-thirds
perished. Often they were brutally murdered
before reaching there, according to De Vigny’s story
of “Laurette or the Red Seal.” The country was
dubbed the “dry guillotine,” and it is said that a prisoner
who had the choice between it and the blood-wet
one in Paris, chose the latter.</p>

<p class='c018'>In 1852 free transportation was offered as a “favor”
and more than 3,000 accepted. In 1854 Napoleon
III, that third-class Napoleon, made Cayenne a penal
colony for his political enemies, as if he hadn’t already
enough crimes to atone for. Between 1852 and 1867,
18,000 exiles were brought over, although New Caledonia
for the next 20 years became the ticket-of-leave
tourist resort. In 1885-7 confirmed criminals, and
those with more than 8-year sentences to hard labor,
were shipped here. However, they have proved unfit
for government employment. Convicts formerly sent
to Caledonia had such lease of long life, that they are
now sent to Guiana to reduce living expenses. Grave-digging,
next to gold-digging, is the principal occupation.</p>

<p class='c018'>In Cayenne, the majority of the prisoners are negroes,
Arabs and Annamites. Now most of the outcasts
are sent to unsaintly St. Laurent. Formerly they were
herded at Cayenne, the three Iles du Salut, on one of
which Captain Dreyfus was imprisoned, and the Kourou
River, La Mere being reserved as a home for the old
and sick. The convicts have trades, and are bakers,
carpenters and tanners, etc. They make curios, such
as balata boats, whips with Kaiser and dog heads on
the handle, separable tables, fibre vanity bags, and
cigar-cutters in the shape of a guillotine. They are
employed as balata-bleeders and in gold-camps, and
have built some thrifty miles of road in the country
where there is little agriculture or cattle-raising. The
little money made is spent on rum and tobacco, and the
franc notes saved are tightly rolled up in a small cylindrical
receptacle which they use as a suppository to
prevent robbery—nevertheless, horrible murders and
mutilations are common. There is the cut-throat class
sent here from Paris for life. Inhabitants tell you that
if they boldly and insultingly beg you for gold, you
should give them lead. Then there is a harmless class
made up of those convicted three times for some petty
offense.</p>
<p class='c003'>Cayenne twice a year. The culprits had steel-cage
cabins to prevent them from jumping overboard and
swimming home across the Atlantic. As the Athenians
sent youths and maidens to be devoured by the Minotaur
every year, so this monstrous country eats up
2,000 convicts annually. In the old days, when a prisoner
died, the corpse was sewn in a sack, taken to the
water and a bell tolled. The sharks knew the sound
and instantly rose to the surface, making it black with
their fins as they hastened to the funeral meat. Felons
with sentences for more than five years are compelled
to serve an additional term of the same period as settlers
in the colony. When a contractor wants convict
labor, he gets it from the government for so much
money if it can be spared. The “liberes,” though having
served their term, are not free to leave the colony,
and since the work is done by the regular prisoners, it
is hard to land a job. Accordingly, many starve to
death, unless they steal provisions. They may be skilful
artisans, but have no tools, are not wanted in town,
so they go to the country to loaf or pilfer, where they
are arrested and punished as tramps. Often for petty
theft an overseer ties his victim to a tree and beats him
with a balata whip. When they do procure work it is
big with little wages. It is impossible for the white
man to work in the sun or stand like a black man all
day in the water. Many convict camps are abandoned
on account of unhealthy surroundings.</p>
<p class='c018'>Poorly fed, the prisoners stalk around like
spectres. They receive scanty rice rations for the
amount of work they do, and are compelled to beg from
everybody. Their murderously-minded Corsican keepers
look like fiends in human form, provoke to kill,
and like the followers of Marquis de Sade, take a mad
pleasure in torture, gloating over the suffering of the
wretches they starve and flog. As companions I prefer
the thief and assassin convict to the jailer with his
white cork helmet jammed down over a low forehead,
his shaggy black brows and lashes from which flash
heartless glances, his long, bandit-like mustachios,
framing a savage slit for a mouth, and his brutal jaw.
Far from the restraint of civilization he becomes a
beast in fury, and loves to torment his charge. Hearts
as well as stones are broken in these prisons. The convict’s
complaint is useless, for his letters are censored,
doctored and amputated before they reach home.
There was one American down here for stealing. He
told a friend of mine he could be trusted up to $500,
but any amount over that he would steal. Escaped
prisoners taken back to Cayenne are often chained to
the deck, lashed and kicked by ruthless black guards,
and left to wallow in their excrement. The mouths of
the rivers are well guarded, and all told there are
about 700 police who set the springs to this death-trap.
Camps are insanitary and full of disease, insects and
vermin. After work the exiles are thrust into dark
cells of decaying barracks. Still they have some privileges
besides death and torture. They are furnished a
piece of ground with necessary tools to work it; allowed
to send home for their families, or to have a contract
marriage if they have been here two years and shown
good behaviour.</p>

<p class='c018'>If the convict escapes, the French officials don’t
care much. He prefers the savage jungle to his savage
keeper, fleeing to the bush not half so wild, through fen
and flood to Brazil, Dutch and British Guiana. With
no weapons for game or hook for fish, they grow mad
with hunger, kill each other and have cannibal feasts,
for which they are guillotined if captured. To avoid
ambush they go in gangs, and when they eat or rest
watch the four points of the compass. Just as America
had an underground railway between the North and
South to aid the fugitive slaves, so in Paramaribo,
Dutch Guiana, there are agents of a society formed in
France who provide food, clothes and money to aid the
convict’s escape. There I was informed that the American
Bauxite Company engages escaped convicts, and
gives them a chance. However, in holy British Guiana,
if caught, they are sent back or given so many days to
leave the colony, in which case they often fly to Venezuela.
Recently there was a frightful murder in the
bush, a man’s head was chopped off and placed in a
canoe to shoot the falls in order to cover traces of the
crime. But as in Eugene Aram, guilt could not be hidden,
for the canoe went over the rapids and falls without
spilling its gruesome cargo; it was beached, discovered;
the assassins were tracked; and an aeroplane
was sent from the penal colony which swooped down
on the murderers like a bird of prey and carried them
off to prison.</p>

<p class='c018'>Paradoxical as it may seem, the salvation of Cayenne
is the convict—he does the work. I talked with a
man who employs convicts and he said they were all
“good” workers. Many of the other inhabitants, who
sweat to get balata and gold, are just as bad outlaws,
their life being one guilty round of drink, seduction,
cruelty and crime.</p>

<p class='c018'>The colony is full of physical as well as moral
lepers. Like the other Guianas, elephantiasis, leprosy
and filthy diseases scurf and scourge. The jungles are
full of envenomed serpents. As for heat, the country
is a few degrees above the equator and many above the
boiling point. This dirty land is washed by the Atlantic,
although the ocean does not, as Euripides says,
wash away the wounds and stain of the world, but
rather washes them here from France. Like a New
York garbage boat carrying refuse to the sea, French
convict ships dump the offal of humanity on these
shores. The Pilgrims came to America with religious
convictions, somewhat different from the convictions
criminal and otherwise those Frenchmen held who settled
Canada, Caledonia and Cayenne. Climate here is
one long season of sorrow. Guiana is an outlaw country,
a jumping-off place of the world, a back-door to
perdition; a dominion of dolour, despair, mud and
blood, where Death is the jailer who frees. The cities
of Cayenne and St. Laurent are cities of dreadful day
and night where spread</p>

<p class='c021'>Faith, hope and charity are banished the colony,

maintaining a hell on earth in French Guiana. Dante
says, “There is a place within the depths of hell called
Malebolge.” His prophetic eye must have seen this
colony accurst, for he peoples the ten gulfs of that
eighth circle of the “Inferno” with seducers, thirsters
for gold, grafters, thieves, peculators, hypocrites, robbers,
forgers and counterfeiters—and punishes these
lost souls with terrible heat, horrible leprosies, poisonous
serpents, filth and scourging demons!</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_7 c017'>ANCIENT mythology and folklore contain innumerable
stories of the creation of the world and
of man. Most of them have this in common that
they relate that, when it came to the creation of woman,
the being who had the task in hand experienced immense
difficulties. According to a supposed legend,
for instance, this is the origin of woman:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Twashtri, the god Vulcan of the Hindu mythology,
created the world, but on his commencing to
create woman he discovered that for man he had exhausted
all his creative materials, and that not one element
had been left. This, of course greatly perplexed
Twashtri, and caused him to fall into a profound meditation.
When he arose from it he proceeded as follows.
He took:</p>

      <div class='line in1'><b>The graceful twist of the creeping plant.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The light shivering of the grass blade and the slenderness  of the willow.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The velvet of the flowers.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The lightness of the feather.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The gentle gaze of the doe.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The frolicsomeness of the dancing sunbeam.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The tears of the cloud.</b></div>

      <div class='line in1'><b>The timidity of the hare.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The vanity of the peacock.</b></div>
      <div class='line in1'><b>The hardness of the diamond.</b></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>All these he mixed together and formed a woman.”</p>
<p class='c018'>This is widely accepted as an ancient Hindu legend
and nobody would suffer very much for continuing to
believe such to be the case, but a gentleman, in answer
to a query the other day, completely destroys the foundations
for this belief. He says: “The legend of the
creation of woman is the creation in English of an English
mind; its author is F. W. Bain, and it is to be found
in his charming book, ‘A Digit of the Moon.’”</p>

<p class='c018'>He had only ten dollars left and thought he would
have a tour on the railway. So he hied himself to a big
ticket office where there was a host of booking clerks
and inquired:</p>

<p class='c018'>“No,” answered the booking clerk.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>BY NEMESIS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c017'>IT is the old, old, story. Sporty married man, trustful
or maybe designing girl, wool over her optics, girl
finally gets wise, recriminations, breach of promise
suit, and—?</p>

<p class='c018'>Hector Havemeyer and Harriet Hearn comprise
the alliterative couple in the calcium effulgence this
time. Havemeyer is a scion of the sugar magnate; one
of whose stunts was to ruin a competitor by bribing a
workman in the rival plant to run a pipe from the syrup
tank to the river and waste fifty or a hundred barrels
a day. We mention this to show that Hector did not
inherit a high standard of principle or regard for the
rights of others.</p>

<p class='c018'>Harriet eked out her truce with profiteering landlords
and dry goods stores by digging muck from under
the claws of such customers as presented themselves
for the purpose. Her modest shingle swung in a barber
shop in the Grand Central Station, Graftopolis-on-the-Harlem,
generally known as New York. Hector
came, he saw, he—well, you can guess the rest. Of
course he proposed marriage. And of course Harriet
sprung the old song and dance about it being “so sudden.”
But when Hector offered as lagniappe to blow
her to a whole slew of diamonds, a kolinsky cape and a
trip South, his suddenness compared to hers as she
Pisa-towered on his caoutchouc and celluloid, mooning:
“Hector, I am thine!” was even as Congress controlling
the trusts to a terrier kyoodle with a turpentine
enema.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fair Harriet was soon installed in a seven-dollar-a-day
suite at a no-questions-asked hotel. Manicurists
seldom can afford such things out of their own
earnings, and we will give our readers three guesses
as to who signed the checks for the rent. As long as
Hector paid he naturally was entitled to call as often
as he darn pleased, which was about once a day and
then some. Not contented with that he would telephone
so often to her at her place of business that her barber
employer ultimatumed that she must either cut it out
or take the gate. Hector also sent flowers and candy
galore. His progenitor had acquired coin in the manner
quoted above; a manner both easy and honorable,
and passed it on to Hector to blow. Hector also pined
for special messages from his Dulcinea del Toboso, and
would employ the red cap porters at the station to go to
her and beseech for him a missive of love to ease his
near ruptured cardiac.</p>

<p class='c018'>The strange part of it all is that at first Hector
was too bashful to go like an avuncular just arrived
from Canajoharie and have Harriet extract the Graftopolis
real estate and microbes from the nether side
of his hive-scratchers. Instead he sought the services
of a New York Central detective as his John Alden,
the fair Harriet states. But she fell for the detective
presented proposition and consented to the introduction.</p>

<p class='c018'>The promise of marriage, which Harriet claims
was made, might have been either the last resort of a
man dealing with a near-Pamela and cute minx combined,
or else a gratuitous piece of calorified atmosphere.
But as she had to know some day that he could
not keep his word without committing bigamy, Hector
preferred that it should be from him rather than from
his vindictive investigating storm-and-strife, or the
serpentine lollypop-licker of Mrs. Grundy. Having had
preliminary practice in another way, he screwed up his
courage and broke the news, although he let her down
easy with the hoary classic bucolic cataplasm about
his wife not understanding him, there would soon be a
divorce, and then his Harriet would be <b>IT</b>. That was
all Harriet wanted to hear. She flew the seven-dollar-a-day
coop whose manager, as there were several times
seven dollars of arrears, was so unkind as to retain her
powder-rag, her tooth-brush, and other feminine impedimenta
which we forbear to catalogue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Harriet went back to finding her own rent-money,
but nevertheless she did not break with her Hector.
Instead she kept Hectoring him with special delivery
letters and telegrams; ditto his wife, although she
charges that in the latter case Hector had fixed all the
apartment house help so that none of her retaliatory
revelations would strike home. She says, too, that
her Lothario had the St. Vitus dance even when she
was not in proximity to him. Seeing that he had taken
her all and given her in return nothing but candy,
flowers and broken promises, she is going to try very
hard to make him pay, and has brought suit for a hundred
thousand dollars. She exults that she did not sell
or give away all her old clothes and resign her position,
as he urged her to do, and says she would not be
in a Gehenna of a fix if she had.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hector claims that Harriet, like himself, is married
to somebody else; a certain Garry Hearn being the
man. But Harriet denies the allegation and defies the
alligator. Hector lives with his wife at 375 Park avenue,
New York. He seems to take it all as a joke, but
his Harriet evidently does not. She alleges that he
wooed and won her under the name of Palmer, and also
that he ungallantly refuses to pay the rest of the rent
so that she can get her needful belongings out of hock;
and, to make matters worse, he will not see her any
more. But she protests her undying love for him in
spite of the way he has wounded her poor, tender little
feelings, which ought to be easy for her, seeing the size
of his saccharine bank-roll. Heads she wins, tails she
loses. Harriet figures she stands to get a slice of it
if he doesn’t make good about divorcing his wife and
marrying her; or, in the other event, she will have the
spending of most of it anyhow. So why shouldn’t modest
little Harriet sue? And echo answers, why?</p>

the cause. You can’t put out the fire by removing the
teakettle to a cooler spot. Therefore you can’t cure
evil thinking by doing away with dancing. Fire, pep,
energy is the natural results we get from the disgusting

the cause, which is eating, evil thinking or dancing,
which is the effect, will cure themselves.</p>

<p class='c025'>The Whiz Bang desires to call the attention of its

“Golightly” Morrill, famous author-traveler-preacher,
who has been a regular correspondent to this magazine.
Mr. Morrill is one of America’s most forceful writers
and his varied experiences as a social worker and globetrotter
fits him to deal trenchantly on varied subjects.

<p class='c018'>Tangier Island, in Chesapeake Bay, is where the
natives still vote for Andrew Jackson. The island is
nothing if not religious in the narrowest and most reactionary
sense of the word. Only one church is on the
island, and those who run it think that hell’s hottest
fires are burning specially for all who do not agree with
each and every religious dogma they have. The minister
is almost qualified to butt into the Trinity and
make it a Quartette. It is against the law to hold or
attend any religious service not under the auspices of
the local church monopoly. It is also required by law
that you attend the church every Sunday, and as if
that is not enough, you are not allowed to be out of
your house on Sunday, not even on your own porch,
except to go to and from church services. It is frankly
claimed by the powers that be, that without such stern
compulsion the natives would desecrate the Sabbath by
congregating at stores or elsewhere, and then, if the
devil should happen to come to claim his own, he might
scoop up the whole island population as a consequence.</p>

<p class='c018'>Roland Parks, a young man 17 years old, a resident
of Tangier Island, was wicked and audacious enough to
cut church service one Sunday and to take the air on
the porch of his house while the meeting was in progress.
Officer Connorton got on the job and ordered him
to come to church. Young Parks refused, Connorton
tried to arrest him, Parks fled, Connorton drew his revolver
and shot Parks, dangerously wounding him.
The inhabitants of the island regret the shooting, but
hold that it would be better for such as Parks to be shot
and killed rather than the law, which they approve,
should be violated.</p>

<p class='c018'>Among the other Puritan blue laws of Tangier
Island are those prohibiting music anywhere during
church service, even though the instrument may be far
away and no sound come through the walls; playing
ball at any time on Sunday, etc.</p>

<p class='c018'>It may be a shock to learn that such archaic conditions
exist anywhere in the world, let alone in our own
country. True enough, we are the most backward
people on earth to control landlords and profiteers.
But it seems that the same may be said of us in regard
to religious tyrants and persecutors.</p>

<p class='c018'>Admitting, for the sake of argument, that things
taboo on Tangier Island displease God, why can’t his
agents safely leave it to Him to enforce His will and
punish those who violate His law? God needs no
human avengers. It is an axiom that the only call for
human legislation is tangible wrong or harm to some
member or members of society.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just here we stopped to look over some exchanges,
and find that the ministers of Lynnbrook, near New
York City, have forced the Sunday closing of a local
amusement park. This will not be allowed to open on
Sunday, not even at hours that do not conflict with
any church services of the day. Give these reverend
gentlemen credit. They did not find shooting necessary
in the process. But give them debit for a senseless
piece of business. With Coney Island and Rockaway
Beach near by, the Lynnbrook people will simply
take a short trolley ride and get what they want much
better. What was accomplished, what could have been
accomplished, to help keep the Sabbath day holy? A
zero with the circle erased. Any sensible man could
have seen this in advance. But who has less sense than
a tyrannical religious fanatic? Only a man who
expects one such to have any sense at all.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'>Woman is creation’s best and last work and should
be the most attractive thing in the universe.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clothes are the index of character. A woman is
known by the dress she wears. A standard of a country’s
or century’s mind and morals is known by its
fashion-plate.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some women are as long in dressing as Caesar was
in marshalling his army. They go to church to show
their clothes, spend more money for hacks than for
Bibles, strut home like peacocks, forgetting that
clothes are but the reminders of lost innocency and that
to be proud of rustling silk is to be like the madman
who laughs at the rattling of his fetters. They only
think of dress, and were you to steal their clothes you
would rob them of the only valuable thing they
possessed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Skirts have been bloated like a balloon and long as
a crocodile’s tail, but now they are meagre as a mummy
and docked like a horse’s tail, for Fashion is a foolish
and freakish goddess.</p>

<p class='c018'>A short skirt is said to be economical in material,
sanitary because it is not a street or sidewalk cleaner,
and comfortable for locomotion—but when art sacrifices
utility in attempt to show the figure, as Venus
before Anchises or Medea before Jason, it is a matter
not only of comment but censure. Too often on leading
thoroughfares we fine a godless model of fashion
which is an insult to sex and an outrage on decency.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'>The first short skirt was made in the Garden of
Eden of fig leaves because there were no Parisian
dressmakers present.</p>

<p class='c018'>Skirt styles today are going back to the original
fig-leaf fashion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mother Eve ate the apple, became “wise” and her
first thought was of dress, and that is all some of her
daughters have thought of since.</p>

<p class='c018'>American women are willing to wear any skirt
that bears a Paris label, but would they if they knew
it was a French fashion to advertise demimondaine
charms?</p>

<p class='c018'>If good women, who wear the suggestive short,
close-fitting and diaphanous skirt, knew what bad men
said when they went by, they would fall dead or call
for a taxi and break the speed limit to get home and
hide in the cellar.</p>

<p class='c018'>Men are a bad lot and women should help them
to be better and not worse.</p>

<p class='c018'>There are men in hospitals and hell who owe their
damnation in time and eternity to the skirts of some
bad, beautiful woman.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fashion is the world’s undertaker and often
charges a woman a big bill for a body with diseased
functions, a mind with dwarfed faculties, and a soul
with a future damned.</p>

<p class='c018'>Girls, whose altar is a looking-glass, and their
Bible a fashion magazine, might well pause to ask
themselves how they will look in their coffin-shroud
when the prevaricating preacher tries to offer some
word of comfort to the mourners, and what they will
say to the great Judge when they stand “naked and
ashamed,” because on earth they wore the skirts of
sin instead of the robe of Christ’s righteousness.</p>

<p class='c018'>With the October issue, Captain Billy’s Whiz Bang
will start its second year. This little publication was
created with the idea of giving the former service men
in the vicinity of Robbinsdale and the Twin Cities a
continuation of the pep and snap we got in the army.
The first run of the press was 2,000 copies. They went
like hot-cakes and “seconds” were necessary. For
several successive months it was necessary to double
our monthly press order. We sincerely tender our
heartfelt thanks for your loyal support and shall
endeavor more than ever to merit your patronage.</p>

<p class='c018'>For the benefit of new readers, as well as the old,
The Whiz Bang will publish its first annual year book
with the October issue. This “Year Book” will contain
in part the livest selections from all previous
issues. The back copies of The Whiz Bank have been
“mopped up” so that it is not possible to fill any orders
for previous issues. The demand for back copies
brought forth the idea of an annual review. The
editor will aim to compile the choicest poems, jests,
jingles and stories from the previous 12 issues into
this October Year Book.</p>

<p class='c018'>One often hears wonder expressed that reputable
persons find apparent pleasure in visiting cafes, road
houses, country clubs or other places of amusement of
questionable character. Yet the psychology of the
matter is not so far to seek. The “young person,” and
many persons continue to remain immature in mind
long beyond the normal period of unripeness, likes to
feel that he is very wise in the ways of the world. A
young man likes to have his actions show that he is “a
man of the world,” even though he may not make the
claim in words. The fact that he is nothing of the
kind urges him on to become better acquainted with
“the primrose paths.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Hence it often results that an innocent young person
will go with others to a restaurant with a shady
reputation, either in the spirit of bravado or to discover
what the secret is. Often enough the place, on
the outside of the life shown there, seems innocent
enough and the visitors wonder at the secrecy, innuendo
and charm draped about the place.</p>

<p class='c018'>The real “man of the world” knows the taste of
the “dead sea fruit” well enough.</p>

<p class='c018'>To be glad of life, because it gives you a chance to
love and to work and to play and to look up at the
stars, to be satisfied with your possessions, but not
contented with yourself until you have made the best
of them; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood
and meanness, and to fear nothing except cowardice;
to be governed by your admirations rather than
by your disgust. To covet nothing that is your neighbor’s
except his kindness of heart and gentleness of
manners; to think seldom of your enemies, often of
your friends, and every day of Christ; and to spend
as much time as you can, with body and with spirit,
in God’s out-of-doors; these are little guide-posts on
the footpath to peace.—Henry Van Dyke.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>By CAPTAIN BILLY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c017'>THERE is something almost amusing about the
violent agitation in Canada and England against
the publications of a well-known American.
The Britishers are working up a boycott against these
periodicals, declaring their pages contain many bitter
insults to old John Bull.</p>

<p class='c018'>Those acquainted with the tribe of England soon
recognize their proud and haughty demeanor. Blood
and lineage cut deep into their flesh and cranium. I
often wonder if the English realize a possibility for
pride in the American people. From my observation
through a wide exchange of British publications, I
have noted 10 insulting stories regarding the Americans
to every one story contained in our newspapers
and magazines of a nature detrimental or slurring to
British cousins.</p>

<p class='c018'>Permit me for a moment to regale you with a few
old stories gleaned from the English:</p>

<p class='c026'><b>Story No. 1.</b>—A teacher asked one of the
class to tell her what the British flag stood
for. “Truth, honor and justice,” replied the
child. “Right,” said the teacher. “Now
Willie, can you tell me what the French flag
stands for?” “Liberty, fraternity and equality,”
piped Willie. “Good,” commented the
teacher. “Reggie, you tell me what the
American flag stands for.” “I don’t know
what it stands for now,” replied the knowing
youth, “but it stood for a devil of a lot during
the first two years of the war.”</p>

<p class='c027'><b>Story No. 2.</b>—One of the first American
soldiers arriving in England went into a public
house and ordered a glass of beer. He was
not used to the non-sparkling English beer
and casually remarked to the barmaid: “Isn’t
this beer a little stale.” “No wonder it’s
stale,” rejoined the lady, “it has been waiting
for you three years.”</p>

<p class='c027'><b>Story No. 3.</b>—“Why are American Tommies
called ‘Doughboys’,” asked a kind lady of an
English soldier. “Well,” theorized the English
soldier, “I suppose it is because they
were kneaded in 1914 and did not rise until
1917.”</p>

<p class='c027'><b>Story No. 4.</b>—A prize was offered at a children’s
entertainment for the lad who could tell
the biggest lie. “I went up in an aeroplane
so high that I could hear the angels sing,”
said the first child. “I went down in a submarine
so far that the water was boiling,”
said the second. “The Americans won the
war,” said the third, and carried off the prize.</p>

<p class='c027'><b>Story No. 5.</b>—An American soldier met a
British soldier in New York. “What mob
did you go over with?” asked the Britisher.
“The Rainbow Division,” responded the
American. “Never heard of it,” laconically
remarked the Britisher. “What,” ejaculated
the American; “never heard of the Rainbow
Division, the famous Rainbow Division.”
“Ah, let me think,” pondered the other; “let
me think; ah, yes, bah jove, that’s the one
that came out after the storm was all over.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The Englishmen admit their insulting stories
about the Americans, but defend the practice by
declaring the stories to be of a friendly character. On
the other hand they declare the American insults to
be bitter. Our “friendly insults” appear to be “a
horse of another color.” What chance is there for
permanent peace?</p>

<p class='c018'>There are ways and other ways, but——</p>

<p class='c018'>“How do you wash your back when you bathe?”
queried one fair maiden of her companion on a streetcar,
as they rode to work one morning last week. “I
just can’t seem to get a satisfactory job on that part
of me.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why—wash my back?” came the instant and
ready reply. “Why, that’s easy. I just soap my back
all over and then lie down in the tub and shimmy.”</p>

    <div>By JANE GAITES</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_65 c017'>ELEVEN o’clock p.m.—a dainty little ankle
adorned by the lace ruffle of a silken pair of
pajamas is drawn under the warm, crisp
covers. A little brunette head is nestled more comfortably
on the soft pillows—two sleepy gray-blue eyes
glance demurely but searchingly around the room. A
tired yawn is suppressed by tiny rosy finger-tips—a
small round arm reaches upward, and, presto—the
lights go out.</p>

<p class='c018'>A moment of struggling is encountered in the
gloom,—follows a turning over, and suddenly the
shapely little head is jerked breathlessly under the
covers. Part of a minute elapses, then—“Ow, help,
murder, police, oh—oh, oh, my God!—a man!”</p>

<p class='c018'>A frantic struggle to turn on the lights commences,
but the poor frightened little slip of a girl
can’t find the switch.</p>

<p class='c018'>An anxious pater rushes in amidst the hysterical
screams of his exceedingly excited wifie who just
knows that she will collapse!</p>

<p class='c018'>Two minutes later, with the lights well on, daughter
is snuggled securely in pater’s protecting arms,—but
where is the man?</p>

<p class='c018'>A faint sound arises from under the blankets, at
which daughter Fanchon screams, and mother, true to
her prediction, faints.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! how terrible is the suspense of that fateful
night! Presently, the “sound” is converted into an
unmistakeable mew—Tabby innocently emerges from
the covers, and demure little Fanchon very conventionally
cries, “Oh, Hell—it’s only the cat!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The sad part about fishing trips this year is that
the fisherman will have to fish.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is next to impossible to get a drink in St. Paul—unless
you have the price.</p>

<p class='c018'>John Smith, Cass Lake, Minn., Indian, says he
fished on the Rainy river 115 years ago. There’s a
mark for some of you fish liars to aim at.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thrift advocates are advising wives to discard all
useless things around the house. It looks bad for a lot
of husbands.</p>

<p class='c018'>Villa supported the rebels until they got into
power, but now he is “agin” them. There must be a
strain of Irish in him.</p>

<p class='c018'>They are still selling beer in England at three
cents a glass. The fare to England is only $179.75.</p>

great slashing in wearing apparel. They must refer
to the laundries.</p>

his own. Would suggest that you send me your picture.
After all I may be wrong.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'><b>L. M. &amp; C. D.</b>—“You are both wrong.” Question
1—It was Richard B. Sheridan the lady was speaking
of. Phil Sheridan took the ride and it was Martin
Sheridan “who threw things,” as you so aptly put it.
Question 2—She must have thought you a couple of
mutts.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'><b>Mr. B.</b>—I am sorry but I know of no way to keep
the ears from flapping. Is Jessie your wife or your
horse?</p>

One should not expect the chicken to be nailed to the

<p class='c018'><b>Henery</b>—If you must speak of them, use the word
“Suspenders.” “Braces” are doubtful, while gallowses,
well, you strike me with horror. Gallowses are
obsolete in good society. Yes, an old-fashioned man is
one who wears suspenders.</p>

in the vestibule. It is not being done these days.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'><b>Bill Grabb</b>—If you think you have a good chance
with the lady and are sure about her income, hire a
taxi. Life is a gamble, anyway. Take a chance; Steve
Brodie did.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'><b>H. G. P.</b>—We thank you for the two following
items. They’re “birds”: A young man and girl
eloped and when they reached Pensacola he wired the
girl’s mother as follows: “Married Gladys in Pensacola
today. Am going to Tampa with her tomorrow.”</p>

can fall into. I dare not advise you.</p>

to use in speaking of a lady’s mouth, unless—unless
she is your wife.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'><b>Harry P.</b>—I am no lawyer. However, I believe
that you have no grounds for a law-suit. You didn’t
have to hold the baby.</p>
<hr class='c019' />
<p class='c018'><b>Miss Dorris M.</b>—Please mention the kind of a
breath your dancing partner had. Also give his name
and address.</p>

a letter to “the lady on your left.”</p>

<p class='c018'><b>Louise</b>—Charles Dickens’ “Curiosity Shop” is
a book, not a store. Give up hunting downtown and
try a library.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
